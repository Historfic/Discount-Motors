# Discount-Motors

Discount Motors is a used car dealership in the UK. They want to lead the way in used cars.
Selling to customers who want the latest and greatest features, without the price tag of a
brand new car.

The UK Government has now announced that from 2030 all new cars will be required to be
zero emissions. Although this wonâ€™t impact the used car market, it is expected that buyers will
give more consideration to the future value of their cars. And petrol and diesel will likely have
a much lower value after 2030.
